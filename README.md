Physics Simulations

An interactive suite of educational physics simulations built with Python, using Tkinter for the GUI and Matplotlib for visualization. Ideal for exploring and teaching fundamental physics concepts.

ðŸ”¬ Simulations Included

Projectile Motion â€“ Explore trajectories with customizable parameters.
Snap Line Tool â€“ Draw and snap lines to curves for geometric analysis.
Simple Harmonic Motion (SHO) â€“ Visualize oscillatory motion and energy transitions.
Elastic Collisions â€“ Study momentum and energy conservation in 1D collisions.
Atwood's Machine â€“ Simulate a pulley system with adjustable masses.
Rigid Body Rotation â€“ Observe rotation with different mass distributions.

Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
2. Install Dependencies
Requires Python 3.8+.

pip install matplotlib numpy


3. (Optional) Set Up Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install matplotlib numpy

Running the App

Start the main menu:

python home_screen.py
A GUI will launch with buttons for each simulation. Click a button to explore that concept. The main menu will return when a simulation window is closed.
